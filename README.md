Hi, i will guide you through what you should do to run the project locally, and if you wanna deploy it on vercel

to run locally:
first clone this repo,
then install the dependencies with "npm install"
then run with "npm run dev"
this will run the project in localhost where you can preview the site live, while modifying it

if you wanna deploy on vercel
create a vercel and github account
create a github repo
clone this repo and push it into your repo
then on vercel, deploy using your own repo
simple as that, more detailed instructions can be found with chatgpt :)
